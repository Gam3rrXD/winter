# RGB SmrtMirror

## Summary

(Not going off of any guides, this is all going to be researched and done by me)

I am going to be bulding an RGB Smart mirror with Alexa support and a Hands Free Experience. I am exited to build this because this has been on my building wishlist for a while and this is finally an opertunity to build it, this would be a great addition to the bathroom or even my bedroom! This would be used for asthetic and as a home automation device. Adding on, I plan to setup a motion sensor so that the screen will turn off when there is no motion aka no one is in the room.
## Plan

1. Get all the material for the build, wait for it to arrive
2. Design an application/plugin using IFTTT or Python to control the Lights and set up AVS along with setting up the motion sensor.
3 Build the frame according to the size of the display and leaving enough wiggle room for the PI to slot in and the speakers to fit
4 Place the display into the frame position the mirror and start prepping the Pi
5 Installing all necessary frameworks (Such as the magic mirror framework and amazon voice services) to operate the PI and seting it up within the frame.
6 Crafting a casing to fit the PI into to protect it
7 Screwing together the rest of the frame and mounting it.
8.Enjoying the mirror!
